It also includes insights from Olympic champion Zheng Siwei on the importance of effective smashing.\nIf you observe the world’s top badminton smashers, you’ll notice that while their techniques may vary, they all share three fundamental practices that enable them to generate immense power in their smashes. This article will break down these techniques and provide actionable tips to help you improve your smash, regardless of your skill level. Stay tuned for insights from Olympic champion Zheng Siwei on what he considers the most crucial aspect of a smash.\n1. Maximizing Rotation Amount\nImportance of Rotation\nOne of the key elements that all professional smashers utilize is maximizing their rotation amount and speed. The more you can rotate your upper body, the greater the distance you have to accelerate your racket, which is essential for achieving a powerful smash.\nTechniques to Enhance Rotation\nTo effectively stretch out your chest during the preparation phase, consider the following tips:\n\n\nTip 1: Sideward Positioning\nEnsure you are facing sideways during your preparation. Even in situations where you have limited time to rotate your legs, the best smashers still manage to rotate their upper body effectively.\n\n\nTip 2: Practice Chest Stretching\nUse a stick to thread through your arms to practice the feeling of stretching out your chest. This exercise will help you understand the correct preparation position.\n\n\n2. Increasing Rotation Speed\nThe Role of Kinetic Chain\nThe speed of your smash is significantly influenced by the rotational speed of your body. This speed is generated through the kinetic chain, which involves the coordinated movement of your legs, hips, and torso.\nUtilizing the Non-Racket Arm\nA crucial yet often overlooked aspect of increasing rotational speed is the effective use of the non-racket arm. Here are two tips to ensure you are using your non-racket arm correctly:\n\n\nTip 1: Maintain Sideward Position\nSimilar to maximizing rotation amount, ensure you are in a sideward position during your preparation phase to utilize your non-racket arm effectively.\n\n\nTip 2: Arm Movement During Rotation\nAs you rotate, bring your non-racket arm down and across your body. This positioning is vital for generating maximum speed and ensuring proper timing when striking the shuttle.\n\n\n3. Achieving Perfect Timing\nImportance of Timing\nPerfect timing is essential for executing an effective smash. Here are three tips to help you achieve this:\n\n\nTip 1: Relaxed Grip\nMaintain a relaxed grip until the moment of contact with the shuttle. This relaxation allows for more power and a crisp sound upon impact. For instance, powerful smasher Praveen Jordan often has three fingers off the grip before hitting his smash.\n\n\nTip 2: Correct Forehand Grip\nEnsure you are using the correct forehand grip so that your racket strings face flat when striking the shuttle. A proper grip facilitates effective rotation and power.\n\n\nTip 3: Dynamic Movement\nPractice your smashing technique while moving, as your technique may differ when stationary.\n\n\nBonus Tip: Bodyweight Movement\nTop smashers often move their body weight forward into the shuttle when executing powerful smashes. However, they can still achieve strong smashes while moving sideways or backward due to their effective rotation, speed, and timing.\n4. Perfect Placement\nWhile power is essential, placement can significantly increase the number of winners you hit. Professional players often smash to areas that are difficult for their opponents to defend. Here are some strategies for effective placement:\n\n\nSingles Strategy\nAim for the sides of the court, as demonstrated by Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen, who successfully hit 85% of his smashes down the lines.\n\n\nDoubles Strategy\nTarget your opponent’s right or left hip, depending on their handedness, or aim down the middle to create confusion.\n\n\nPractice for Placement\nTo improve your placement, consider reducing the power of your smash. Hitting with 80 to 90% power but focusing on placement can yield better results than hitting with full power directly to your opponent.\nConclusion: Insights from Zheng Siwei\nAs we conclude our exploration of effective smashing techniques, let’s reflect on the advice from Olympic champion Zheng Siwei. He emphasizes that a powerful smash is not effective if it does not lead to a point. Instead, he advocates for smashing with good placement, which can often be more beneficial than sheer power.\nBy implementing these techniques and focusing on placement, you can enhance your smashing ability and play more effectively on the court. For further improvement, consider exploring in-depth tutorials and training programs that focus on strength and speed.\n\nGenerated by Galaxy.ai YouTube Summarizer"},"Badminton/Badminton-SMASH-Tutorial---Improve-Your-POWER-and-Timing!":{"title":"Badminton SMASH Tutorial - Improve Your POWER and Timing!","links":["Badminton/3-Things-Pro-Badminton-Players-Do-On-Their-Smash-(that-you-should-too)"],"tags":["Badminton/Smash","Badminton/Tutorial"],"content":"Find more at:\n\n3 Things Pro Badminton Players Do On Their Smash (that you should too)\n\n\nCredit: www.youtube.com/@BadmintonInsight\n\nWARNING: \n\nPreparation\n\n\nBehind the shuttle \nThe body posture \nThe grip \n\nHitting the shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Point\n\n!!! Important\n\n\n\n\nMastering the Badminton Smash: Techniques for Power and Timing\n\nTLDR: This comprehensive guide explores the essential techniques and tips for improving your badminton smash, focusing on power generation, timing, and proper positioning. It emphasizes the importance of body rotation, grip, and practice to enhance your performance on the court.\n\nBadminton enthusiasts often find themselves wishing for a more powerful smash or struggling with timing. In this guide, we will break down everything you need to know about the smash, including techniques and tips to enhance your power and timing. After extensive research and understanding common mistakes, we aim to provide you with a clear path to mastering this crucial shot.\nUnderstanding the Smash\nThe smash is a key shot in badminton that every player aspires to perfect. However, it is essential to recognize that the smash should not be used indiscriminately. If your opponent has lifted the shuttle to the back line or if you are out of position, attempting a smash could lead to losing the rally. Instead, wait for the right opportunity, such as a shorter lift, to execute your smash effectively.\nPreparation for the Smash\nPositioning\nTo generate maximum power, positioning is critical. You should aim to be approximately half a meter behind the shuttle when preparing to hit it. This positioning allows your body to rotate forward into the shot, which is vital for generating power. Being behind the shuttle is essential regardless of the type of smash you are executing, whether it’s a scissor kick smash, a jump out, or a jump smash.\nBody Orientation\nYour body should face sideways with your racket arm at a 90-degree angle. The non-racket arm should point upwards to assist with timing, balance, and rotation. Avoid tucking your body too tightly, as this can hinder your rotation and reduce the power of your smash.\nGrip Technique\nFor grip, use a forehand grip. If you tend to slice the shuttle, adjust your grip slightly towards a panhandle grip to achieve a flatter face on impact. Keep your racket loose until the last moment to maximize racket head speed, and hold your hand low on the grip to create a longer lever.\nGenerating Power Through Rotation\nThe smash’s power comes from the coordinated rotation of your hips, torso, and shoulders. Here’s how to effectively generate energy:\n\nLegs: Start by generating energy from your legs.\nHips: Rotate your hips to initiate the movement.\nTorso: Follow with your upper torso rotation.\nShoulders and Elbow: Allow your shoulders and elbow to come through, followed by your forearm and wrist.\n\nThis sequence should happen quickly to create a fluid motion, which is crucial for perfect timing. Many players underestimate the importance of this rotation, which is often the differentiator between intermediate and advanced players.\nThe Role of the Core\nYour core plays a significant role in this rotation. It is essential to develop the ability to rotate your trunk quickly. As you prepare to hit, your core should decelerate slightly before the shot, allowing for a more powerful final movement. Keeping your elbow back during this rotation helps stretch your chest, leading to a more forceful follow-through.\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\nMisunderstanding Forearm Rotation\nA common misconception is that forearm rotation contributes significantly to smash power. In reality, forearm rotation is a result of internal shoulder rotation. This movement helps position your elbow correctly, allowing for faster racket head speed.\nHitting Technique\nEnsure you hit the shuttle in front of you, avoiding a completely straight arm at the point of contact. The optimal contact point is slightly above the center of the strings, which can be challenging to practice but is crucial for effective smashing.\nThe Importance of Placement\nWhile power is essential, placement is equally important. A well-placed smash can be more effective than a powerful but poorly directed one. Therefore, focus on both aspects to enhance your overall game.\nStaying Relaxed for Speed\nTop players maintain a relaxed grip until the last moment, allowing for increased racket speed. This technique involves keeping your fingers lightly touching the racket until just before striking the shuttle, which helps generate additional speed.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, mastering the badminton smash involves:\n\nProper preparation and positioning behind the shuttle.\nUsing a forehand grip and maintaining a loose hold.\nGenerating power through coordinated body rotation.\nEnsuring a clean contact with the shuttle without slicing.\n\nImproving your smash requires practice and attention to detail. By focusing on these techniques and avoiding common mistakes, you can significantly enhance your smash power and timing. Remember, strength training, particularly for the back of your shoulder, can also aid in injury prevention and improve your overall performance.\nStay tuned for our next video, where we will delve into the jump smash, another exciting aspect of badminton that can elevate your game even further!\n\nGenerated by Galaxy.ai YouTube Summarizer"},"Badminton/Badminton-Specific-Muscle-Training-Guide":{"title":"Comprehensive Guide to Badminton-Specific Muscle Training","links":[],"tags":["Badminton/Fitness","Badminton/Training"],"content":"Badminton-Specific Muscle Training Guide\nKey Exercises for Badminton Players\n1.

PMF ensures the product addresses a need but does not guarantee success beyond initial traction.\nCompanies need to bridge the “Product-Company Gap,” focusing on repeatable sales, pricing models, and customer scaling strategies.\n\n\n\n(02:43-05:48) Learning from Failures and Successes:\n\nExample: Padient, a QR-based mobile payment company, failed to scale due to challenges in enterprise adoption despite technical success.\nContrast: YouTube succeeded by finding a scalable model through advertising post-acquisition by Google.\n\n\n\n(05:48-09:54) Scaling Expenses Flip:\n\nEarly-stage startups focus on R&amp;D and product development, but as they scale, expenses shift towards sales and marketing.\nMature SaaS companies typically allocate 60% of revenue to SG&amp;A (sales, general, and administrative) and 20% to R&amp;D.\n\n\n\n(12:26-18:32) Minimum Viable Segment (MVS):\n\nA key strategy for scaling is targeting a small, specific segment (MVS) within the broader market to prove repeatability and validate the product.\nExample: A healthcare hiring platform initially targeted only nurses and later expanded to broader segments.\n\n\n\n(18:32-21:36) Importance of Customer Feedback:\n\nConducting extensive customer interviews (e.g., 200 potential users) is critical to understanding pain points and identifying the ideal initial market segment.\n\n\n\n(32:52-36:32) SLIP Framework for Easy Product Adoption:\n\nS: Simple to install and use\nL: Low to no initial cost\nI: Instant and ongoing value\nP: Plays well in the ecosystem\nThis framework ensures products are easy to adopt, reducing friction for customers.\n\n\n\n(55:40-59:48) The Role of Pricing and Partnerships:\n\nPricing should evolve with the customer journey, starting with free trials or freemium models and scaling up as value increases.\nStrategic partnerships, such as Clavio with Shopify, can accelerate growth by leveraging established ecosystems.\n\n\n\n(59:48-1:03:20) Strategic Partnerships for Scaling:\n\nCompanies can collaborate with distributors, tech partners, or large players in their industry to expand reach and credibility.\n\n\n\n(1:03:53-End) Final Advice:\n\nAlways design with scalability and repeatability in mind. Validate ideas with a minimum viable segment and think about go-to-market fit and pricing strategies early on.\nNetworking, feedback, and partnerships are key components of successfully scaling a product into a company.\n\n\n"},"Product-Build/Harvard-Innovation-Lab/Value-Propositions---Crafting-Products-That-Solve-Real-Problems":{"title":"Value Propositions: Crafting Products That Solve Real Problems","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nHere’s a summary of the key points from the transcript of “Value Props: Create a Product People Will Actually Buy”:\nDefining a Value Proposition (VP)\n\n\n(00:01 - 00:35) Importance of Value Props\n\nThe #1 reason companies fail: not solving a valuable enough problem.\nThe goal: Define the problem/opportunity, evaluate it, and create a strong value proposition.\n\n\n\n(00:59 - 01:51) Ideas vs. Solving Real Problems\n\nIdeas are meaningless unless they solve a real problem.\nA VP should clearly define the problem and be compelling enough for people to buy.\nFramework: For who, dissatisfied with what, due to what unmet need, we offer a product that solves it, with key benefits.\n\n\n\nIdentifying and Segmenting the Market\n\n\n(02:27 - 04:53) Knowing Your Customer (For Who)\n\nClearly define who your product is for;

(USE THIS ONE)==\n\n\nIf you’re managing multiple images and complex metadata, consider combining EXIF for basic data and a metadata file for advanced data. Let me know your specific use case, and I can provide more tailored guidance!\nEmbedding information into an image file depends on the type and size of the data you want to embed, as well as the purpose of embedding. Here are some suggested solutions based on your requirements:\n\n1. Use EXIF Metadata (For Standardized Small Data)\nBest For: Embedding small, standardized pieces of information, like titles, authorship, categories, and simple custom data.\n\n\nPros:\n\nSupported by most image formats (JPEG, TIFF, etc.).\nEasily accessible via tools like Android’s ExifInterface, ExifTool, or Python libraries.\nLightweight and efficient.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nLimited size (typically up to ~64 KB for the entire EXIF block).\nNot suited for complex or large data (e.g., long JSON, binary content).\n\n\n\nHow to Implement:\n\n\nEmbed your information into predefined EXIF tags or flexible tags like UserComment or ImageDescription.\n\n\nFor example:\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;json&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code id=&quot;code-lang-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;&quot;Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Funny Meme&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;&quot;Category&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Humor&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;&quot;Author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Vy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\nSave this JSON as a string in the UserComment tag.\n\n\n\n2. Use Steganography (For Invisible Data Storage)\nBest For: Hiding information in an image file (e.g., for security or unobtrusive purposes).\n\n\nPros:\n\nData is embedded directly into the image pixels, invisible to viewers.\nCan store relatively large amounts of data without noticeable changes to the image.\nWorks with any image format.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nRequires specialized tools to read/write the hidden data.\nMay slightly increase the image size or degrade quality if not done carefully.\n\n\n\nHow to Implement:\n\nUse a steganography library or tool like Stegano (Python) or third-party apps.\nEmbed data such as JSON or text into the least significant bits (LSB) of pixel values.\n\n\n3. Append Data at the File’s End (For Large or Custom Data)\nBest For: Embedding custom or large data (e.g., JSON, XML, or binary files) without modifying the image’s visual content.\n\n\nPros:\n\nNo restrictions on data size or format.\nThe image remains viewable as normal.\nEasy to extract data programmatically.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nRequires custom implementation to read/write the appended data.\nNot a standardized method, so compatibility with tools may vary.\n\n\n\nHow to Implement:\n\n\nOpen the image file in binary mode and append your custom data after the EOF marker.\n\n\nExample in Python:\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;python&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code id=&quot;code-lang-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;&quot;image.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;&quot;ab&quot;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; img_file:\n    img_file.write(&lt;span&gt;b&quot;\\n&amp;lt;!-- Custom Metadata --&amp;gt;\\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)\n    img_file.write(&lt;span&gt;b&#039;{&quot;Title&quot;: &quot;Funny Meme&quot;, &quot;Author&quot;: &quot;Vy&quot;}&#039;&lt;/span&gt;)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n4. Embed Metadata in a Separate File (Metadata File Approach)\nBest For: Keeping the original image intact and storing complex or large metadata.\n\n\nPros:\n\nNo impact on the image file size or quality.\nCan store extensive metadata, including complex JSON structures.\nEasy to share or update metadata independently of the image.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nMetadata must be managed as a separate file.\nRelies on users keeping the metadata file with the image.\n\n\n\nHow to Implement:\n\n\nCreate a metadata.json file that maps image filenames to their metadata:\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;json&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code id=&quot;code-lang-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;&quot;image1.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Funny Meme&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Category&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Humor&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Vy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;&quot;image2.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Motivational Meme&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Category&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Inspiration&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Vy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\nDistribute the image and metadata files together (e.g., in a ZIP file).\n\n\n\n5. Use XMP Metadata (For Cross-Platform Rich Metadata)\nBest For: Embedding structured, XML-based metadata that exceeds EXIF’s limitations.\n\n\nPros:\n\nSupports large and complex metadata (like JSON or XML).\nCross-platform compatibility (supported by Adobe tools, PDF, and more).\nEmbedded within the file in a standardized way.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nRequires libraries to read/write XMP data (e.g., Apache Commons Imaging, Exempi).\nLarger metadata can slightly increase file size.\n\n\n\nHow to Implement:\n\n\nUse tools like Adobe Photoshop or programmatically with libraries to embed XMP metadata.\n\n\nExample XML structure for XMP:\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;xml&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code id=&quot;code-lang-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;x:xmpmeta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;xmlns:x&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;&quot;adobe:ns:meta/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;rdf:RDF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;xmlns:rdf&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;&quot;www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;rdf:Description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;xmlns:dc&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;&quot;purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;dc:title&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Funny Meme&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span&gt;dc:title&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;dc:creator&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Vy&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span&gt;dc:creator&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;dc:subject&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Humor&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span&gt;dc:subject&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span&gt;rdf:Description&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span&gt;rdf:RDF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span&gt;x:xmpmeta&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n"},"💡Ideas/NewsChat/MVP---Part-1":{"title":"Turning Articles into Chat Rooms: NewsChat's Fun Experiment","links":["💡Ideas/NewsChat/NewsChat---Bringing-News-to-Life"],"tags":["GenZ","AndroidApp","NewsChat"],"content":"\nTL;DR\nNewsChat is turning articles into fun comment sections packed with slang, memes, and emojis for Gen Z vibes.

They’re brainstorming their next big idea—a fresh take on an old project they once worked on, NewSound.\n“Do you remember NewSound?” Minh starts, taking a sip of his espresso. “We had a good thing going, but it didn’t really stick.”\n“Yeah,” Huy replies, leaning back in his chair. “We built it to aggregate news from local RSS feeds, but it was just another news app in the end. Too… dry, maybe?”\nMinh nods thoughtfully. “Exactly. People didn’t engage with it. But you know what I’ve been thinking? When we read something interesting online, what’s the first thing we do?”\n“Discuss it,” Huy says without hesitation. “Share it in a group chat, argue over the details, or just laugh about it.”\n“Exactly!” Minh’s eyes light up. “What if we skipped the middle step? What if the article itself was already a conversation?”\nHuy raises an eyebrow, intrigued. “Go on…”\n\nThe Idea Behind NewsChat\nInnovationMessengerIntegrationKotlinProblemSolver\nThe duo’s concept is deceptively simple but undeniably clever. NewsChat aims to transform traditional news articles into dynamic, engaging group chat conversations. Using RSS feeds from local news sources, the app will leverage generative AI to reformat articles as if they were discussions between friends in a Messenger group chat.\nFor example, a long-winded article about a city council meeting might become a playful back-and-forth:\n\nMinh: Did you hear about the new bike lanes downtown?\nHuy: Oh yeah, finally! But have you seen the comments section? People are mad!\nMinh: Always. Can’t please everyone. But hey, no more excuses for me to skip cycling.\n\nBy structuring articles in this way, NewsChat turns dense paragraphs into bite-sized, relatable pieces of information. It’s not just reading the news—it’s feeling like you’re part of the conversation.\n\nMaking News Feel Human Again\nAudienceCleanDesignAndroidAppEntertainmentApp\n“Here’s the thing,” Minh explains. “News can feel overwhelming. There’s so much information, and it’s all presented so… formally. But when you read it like this, as a conversation, it feels more natural. You’re not just absorbing information—you’re connecting with it.”\nHuy chimes in. “Exactly. It’s like bringing the water cooler talk straight into the app. And with AI, we can even adjust the tone. Serious for hard news, playful for entertainment. The possibilities are huge.”\nThey sketch out some initial features:\n\nLocal RSS Integration: Pulling in news from local outlets.\nAI-Powered Conversational Formatting: Using generative AI to reformat content.\nCustomizable Personas: Users can choose the ‘voices’ in the chat—funny, serious, or even themed characters like a historian for historical news.\n\n\nFrom NewSound to NewsChat\nDevelopersInnovationMobileDevelopmentProblemSolving\nThe shift from NewSound to NewsChat marks a dramatic evolution for Minh and Huy. While NewSound aimed to deliver news efficiently, NewsChat aims to humanize it.\n“We don’t just want people to consume news,” Minh says. “We want them to enjoy it, discuss it, and share it. It’s about creating a connection.”\n“And maybe,” Huy adds with a grin, “actually get through a whole article without getting bored halfway.”\n\nThe Road Ahead\nAndroidDevelopmentAppCollectionAudienceInsights\nThe duo knows they have their work cut out for them. There’s coding to do, AI models to fine-tune, and endless user testing ahead. But for now, the excitement of breathing life back into an old idea keeps them going.\n“Here’s to NewsChat,” Minh says, raising his coffee cup.\n“To making news conversational again,” Huy replies, clinking his cup with Minh’s.\nAs they dive back into their laptops, it’s clear that NewsChat is more than just an app—it’s a new way to engage with the stories that shape our world, one chat bubble at a time.\n\nMVP - Part 1"},"🤖Android/ABlink/ABlink---Building-the-Perfect-1x1-Widget-Part-2":{"title":"Building the Perfect 1x1 Widget (Part 2)","links":["tags/ABlink","tags/Widgets","tags/HomeScreenWidgets","tags/UXDesign","tags/AvatarCustomization","tags/ShortcutCustomization","tags/AndroidOS"],"tags":["ABlink","Widgets","HomeScreenWidgets","UXDesign","AvatarCustomization","ShortcutCustomization","AndroidOS"],"content":"\nTL;DR: I designed a simple 1x1 widget with options for avatar size, cropping styles, editable title, hide title, and contact selection.

I also looked at how the Shortcut Maker app (play.google.com/store/apps/details) approaches widget customization. Inspired by its flexibility, I decided to offer a similar feature set but keep things even simpler – no unnecessary steps, just a quick and easy process.\nWidget Configuration Features\nHere’s what users can customize:\n\n\nAvatar Size:\n\nThree options: Small, Medium (default), and Large.\n\n\n\nAvatar Cropping:\n\nThree styles:\n\nCircle Crop\nSamsung-like Round Corner\nRectangle Round Corner\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle (Contact Name):\n\nUsers can edit the title if they want to customize it.\nDefault: Contact name.\n\n\n\nHide Title Option:\n\nSome users prefer a clean home screen with just the avatar.\nThis option allows hiding the title entirely.\n\n\n\nContact Selection:\n\nUsers can quickly pick a contact from their list to create the widget.\n\n\n\nKeeping It Simple\nThe goal is to give users enough flexibility without wasting their time. With these options, anyone can set up a clean and functional shortcut in just a few taps.\n\ndate: 2025-01-02T14:16:15+07:00\nNo valid YouTube link found in the clipboard.\nWhat’s Next?\nOn Day 3, I’ll focus on implementing these features and ensuring the widget runs smoothly on different devices.\n\nTags:\nABlinkWidgetsHomeScreenWidgetsUXDesignAvatarCustomizationShortcutCustomizationAndroidOS\n"},"🤖Android/ABlink/ABlink---Coding-the-Customizable-Widget---Part-3":{"title":"Coding the Customizable Widget (Part 3)","links":["tags/ABlink","tags/AndroidDevelopment","tags/AppWidgets","tags/WidgetConfiguration","tags/RemoteViews","tags/AppWidgetManager","tags/PendingIntent","tags/HomeScreenCustomization","tags/AndroidManifest","tags/CustomWidgets","tags/AndroidOS","🤖Android/ABlink/ABlink---Fixing-Contact-Shortcuts-on-Android---Part-1","🤖Android/ABlink/ABlink---Building-the-Perfect-1x1-Widget-Part-2"],"tags":["ABlink","AndroidDevelopment","AppWidgets","WidgetConfiguration","RemoteViews","AppWidgetManager","PendingIntent","HomeScreenCustomization","AndroidManifest","CustomWidgets","AndroidOS"],"content":"Here is the reformatted markdown to display correctly in Quartz (Obsidian):\n\n\nTL;DR:\nI started coding the widget. First, I declared a configuration activity in the AndroidManifest. Then, I created the AppWidgetProviderInfo XML to define key properties like size, preview, and behavior for the widget.\n\nDay 3: Getting into the Code\nWith the design and features planned, I began coding ABlink’s customizable widget. My goal for the day was to configure the widget setup and layout using Android’s guidelines.\nStep 1: Setting Up the Configuration Activity\nA configuration activity lets users customize the widget during its setup process. This is a special type of activity that Android launches when the user adds the widget to their home screen.\nKey Steps:\n\nDeclare the configuration activity in the AndroidManifest.xml:\n\n&lt;activity\n    android:name=&quot;.WidgetConfigurationActivity&quot;\n    android:exported=&quot;true&quot;\n    android:theme=&quot;@style/BottomSheetActivityTheme&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n        &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n&lt;/activity&gt;\n\nThe intent-filter tells the OS that this activity handles widget configuration using the APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE action.\nThe android:theme attribute applies a modern look to the activity, such as a bottom sheet for better UX.\n\n\nImplement the configuration activity:\nIn this activity, collect user input (e.g., text, image preferences, or layout options). Once users complete customization, return the appWidgetId and any settings back to the system via an Intent.\n\nval resultIntent = Intent()\nresultIntent.putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, appWidgetId)\nresultIntent.putExtra(&quot;custom_setting_key&quot;, &quot;custom_value&quot;)\nsetResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, resultIntent)\nfinish()\n\nEXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID: Links the configuration activity to the specific widget instance.\nsetResult: Signals the system that the configuration is complete.\n\n\nPersist user preferences:\nStore the widget’s settings using SharedPreferences or a database so they persist across device reboots.\n\n\nStep 2: AppWidgetProviderInfo XML\nNext, I created the AppWidgetProviderInfo XML file. This file defines essential details for the widget, like its size, behavior, and preview layout. It also specifies how the OS should interact with the widget.\nHere’s an example file:\n&lt;appwidget-provider\n    xmlns:android=&quot;schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\n    android:minWidth=&quot;40dp&quot;\n    android:minHeight=&quot;40dp&quot;\n    android:targetCellWidth=&quot;1&quot;\n    android:targetCellHeight=&quot;1&quot;\n    android:maxResizeWidth=&quot;250dp&quot;\n    android:maxResizeHeight=&quot;120dp&quot;\n    android:updatePeriodMillis=&quot;86400000&quot;\n    android:description=&quot;@string/example_appwidget_description&quot;\n    android:previewLayout=&quot;@layout/example_appwidget_preview&quot;\n    android:initialLayout=&quot;@layout/example_loading_appwidget&quot;\n    android:configure=&quot;com.example.android.WidgetConfigurationActivity&quot;\n    android:resizeMode=&quot;horizontal|vertical&quot;\n    android:widgetCategory=&quot;home_screen&quot;\n    android:widgetFeatures=&quot;reconfigurable|configuration_optional&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/appwidget-provider&gt;\nmine is:\n\n\nStep 3: Building the Widget Layout\nWidgets rely on RemoteViews to display their content. Since widgets are rendered outside your app’s context, only certain views (like ImageView and TextView) and operations are supported.\n\nCreate a layout file:\nDefine the widget’s appearance using XML. For example:\n\n&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=&quot;schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\n    android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\n    android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;ImageView\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/widget_image&quot;\n        android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\n        android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\n        android:src=&quot;@drawable/ic_placeholder&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;TextView\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/widget_text&quot;\n        android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\n        android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\n        android:text=&quot;@string/widget_text&quot;\n        android:textSize=&quot;16sp&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;\n\nSet up dynamic views:\nUse RemoteViews to update widget elements programmatically. For example:\n\nval views = RemoteViews(context.packageName, R.layout.widget_layout)\nviews.setTextViewText(R.id.widget_text, &quot;Hello Widget!&quot;)\nviews.setImageViewResource(R.id.widget_image, R.drawable.ic_example)\nAppWidgetManager.getInstance(context).updateAppWidget(appWidgetId, views)\n \n\nStep 4: Updating the Widget\nWidgets must be updated manually or on a schedule, and the appWidgetId plays a critical role in identifying which widget instance to update.\nExample of Retrieving appWidgetId:\nval appWidgetId = intent?.getIntExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID)\nif (appWidgetId == AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID) {\n    finish() // Exit if the ID is invalid\n}\nOnce you have the appWidgetId, you can save configuration data (e.g., user preferences) using SharedPreferences or a database and use it to update specific widget instances.\n\nHandling Widget Removal\nWhen a widget is deleted, clean up its associated data by using onDeleted() or onDisabled() in the AppWidgetProvider. For example:\noverride fun onDeleted(context: Context, appWidgetIds: IntArray) {\n    val sharedPreferences = context.getSharedPreferences(&quot;WidgetPrefs&quot;, Context.MODE_PRIVATE)\n    appWidgetIds.forEach { id -&gt; sharedPreferences.edit().remove(&quot;key_$id&quot;).apply() }\n}\nBy carefully managing the appWidgetId, you ensure that each widget instance is updated and handled independently, providing a seamless user experience.\nTags:\nABlinkAndroidDevelopmentAppWidgetsWidgetConfigurationRemoteViewsAppWidgetManagerPendingIntentHomeScreenCustomizationAndroidManifestCustomWidgetsAndroidOS\nABlink - Fixing Contact Shortcuts on Android - Part 1\nABlink - Building the Perfect 1x1 Widget Part 2"},"🤖Android/ABlink/ABlink---Fixing-Contact-Shortcuts-on-Android---Part-1":{"title":"Fixing Contact Shortcuts on Android (Part 1)","links":["tags/ABlink","tags/AndroidDevelopment","tags/Widgets","tags/HomeScreenCustomization","tags/PinnedShortcuts","tags/CleanDesign","🤖Android/ABlink/ABlink---Building-the-Perfect-1x1-Widget-Part-2","🤖Android/ABlink/ABlink---Coding-the-Customizable-Widget---Part-3"],"tags":["ABlink","AndroidDevelopment","Widgets","HomeScreenCustomization","PinnedShortcuts","CleanDesign"],"content":"\nTL;DR: Pinned shortcuts add app icons by default. I found that widgets can display a cleaner layout, so I’m switching to widgets for custom shortcuts.\n\nDay 1: The Shortcut Problem\nI added a “pinned shortcut” feature to ABlink so users could create quick access to a contact on their home screen. It worked, but there was one problem:\nThe shortcut showed the contact’s avatar but also added ABlink’s app icon at the bottom-right. It didn’t look clean – I wanted the shortcut to show only the avatar and the contact’s name.\n\nThe Fix\nI did some research and found that Android widgets are the solution. Widgets let developers design custom layouts for the home screen and handle clicks. Unlike pinned shortcuts, widgets can display content exactly how you want it – no extra icons.\n\nLeft: Pinned Shortcut - Right: Widget\nWhat’s Next?\nNext, I’ll design a widget that only shows the avatar and contact name, just as I imagined.\nTags:\nABlinkAndroidDevelopmentWidgetsHomeScreenCustomizationPinnedShortcutsCleanDesign\n(Check out Android’s developer docs here)\nwww.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-basic-widget-of-an-android-app/\nABlink - Building the Perfect 1x1 Widget Part 2\nABlink - Coding the Customizable Widget - Part 3"},"🤖Android/ABlink/ABlink---Marketing":{"title":"Marketing Strategy","links":["tags/ProductivityApp","tags/MessengerTips","tags/TechHacks"],"tags":["ABlink","Android","MessengerIntegration","ShortcutCustomization","ShareMenu","Marketing","ProductivityApp","MessengerTips","TechHacks"],"content":"\nMe:\nMy app’s ABlink, it has two core feature: 1.

Turn on the ABlink2. Share with ABlink\nIntroducing a Powerful New Feature in ABlink: Contextual Menu Integration\nAt ABlink, we’re constantly looking for ways to make sharing and interacting with your favorite content even more seamless and efficient. Today, we’re thrilled to announce the latest enhancement to ABlink—integration with Android’s contextual text selection menu! This feature leverages the PROCESS_TEXT intent, providing you with a more intuitive way to interact with text directly within any app that supports it.\nThe Problem We Solved\nPreviously, sharing or processing text from other apps required extra steps, such as copying the text, switching to ABlink, and pasting it for further actions. While this worked, we knew it could be smoother. Inspired by the issues solved discussed in this Stack Overflow thread and guided by best practices outlined in this developer blog post, we’ve implemented a feature that significantly reduces friction when processing text.\nWhat’s New?\nWith the new contextual menu integration, ABlink now appears as an option in the text selection menu whenever you highlight text in apps that support the PROCESS_TEXT action. This means you can:\n\nQuickly share text to your favorite Messenger contact.\nAnalyze text for potential scams using our VirusTotal API integration.\nPerform other actions directly, without leaving the current app.\n\nHow It Works\nHere’s what happens under the hood:\n\nWhen you select text in a compatible app, ABlink will appear in the contextual menu under the “Share” options.\nClicking the ABlink action sends the selected text to our app, where you already:\n\nCopied the text into clipboard for future use\nOpen your contacts - ready to send\n\n\n\nWe’ve also added an intuitive action label, “(ABlink) Share,” making it short and clear.\n\n(Nerdy here) A Simple Setup for Developers\nFor those curious about the technical implementation, this feature uses the PROCESS_TEXT intent filter in the AndroidManifest.xml file:\n&lt;activity\n    android:name=&quot;.YourActivity&quot;\n    android:permission=&quot;android.permission.PROCESS_TEXT&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n        &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.PROCESS_TEXT&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.DEFAULT&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;data android:mimeType=&quot;text/plain&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n&lt;/activity&gt;\nTo enhance user experience, we added a descriptive label with an emoji:\n&lt;string name=&quot;contextual_action_label&quot;&gt;(ABlink) Share 📤&lt;/string&gt;\nThis ensures ABlink stands out in the contextual menu, offering clarity and branding.\nWhy This Matters\nThis update saves time and makes ABlink even more accessible. Whether you’re scanning a suspicious message, sharing a quick note, or interacting with text in any supported app, ABlink now blends seamlessly into your workflow.\nTry It Out!\nTo experience this new feature, update to the latest version of ABlink. Highlight any text in a compatible app, tap the contextual menu, and look for “(ABlink) Share.” It’s that simple!\nWe’re excited to hear your feedback on this feature and how it improves your experience. Let us know your thoughts, and stay tuned for more updates as we continue to make ABlink the go-to app for sharing and security."}}
